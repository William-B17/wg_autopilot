# wg_autopilot

This script will only run properly on ESX

# wg_autopilot

This is a autopilot script for fivem that only works if you are in a correct vehicle 

## Requirements

- None :)

## Installation

1. Add, Delete or Change models under `acceptedvehs` in `vs_client.lua`.

2. Remember to add `start wg_autopilot` to your server.cfg.


## ps

I decided not to add a config.lua because the script is small.

If any problems occur please contact me on discord at `william_g#9763`.
