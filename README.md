This script will only run properly on ESX

# wg_autopilot

This is a autopilot script for fivem that only works if you are in a correct vehicle 

## Requirements

- None :) (only esx)

## Installation

1. Add, Delete or Change models under 'acceptedvehs' .

2. Remember to add wg_autopilot to your server.cfg 'start wg_autopilot'.


## ps

I decided not to add a config.lua because the script is small.
